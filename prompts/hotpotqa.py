Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, and Action can be three types: 
(1) Search[entity], which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search.
(2) Lookup[keyword], which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current passage.
(3) Finish[answer], which returns the answer and finishes the task.
Here are some examples.

Important Rules:
1. Each Thought and Action pair must be self-contained and logically independent from others. They should not rely on information that would be obtained in another Thought or Action.
2. When proposing Thoughts, consider multiple plausible directions or strategies for reasoning, but avoid assuming information that would depend on the outcome of another Thought or Action.
3. If an Action references prior knowledge, ensure that it is explicitly stated in the Current context or in the Question.

Now, given the current context of the question and the reasoning, provide 4 possible future reasoning paths.
For each path, provide a Thought and an associated Action.

Example Structure:

value_prompt = '''
Evaluate the likelihood that the following reasoning path will lead to the correct answer (high/medium/low). 
Provide your evaluation based on the trajectory of the reaosning path as well as past information gathered, and judge whether this will lead to a correct answer. 
Provide a brief justification for this evaluation. You should put the evaluation (high/medium/low) at the very start of your evaluation

Question: 
What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?

Context: 

Thought: I need to find out the professions of Nicholas Ray.
Action: Search[Nicholas Ray]  
Observation: Nicholas Ray was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor, best known for "Rebel Without a Cause".

Thought: Now I need to find out the professions of Elia Kazan to see if they share any.
Action: Search[Elia Kazan]  
Observation: Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter, and actor.

Reasoning Path:
Thought: Both Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan worked as directors and screenwriters, so I need to check if they also share the actor role.
Action: Lookup[actor]

Likelihood and Evaluation: (First word need to be either high, medium, or low)
High
This reasoning path has a high likelihood of leading to the correct answer. Both individuals' professions have been partly identified, and the user is now verifying if they share the actor role, which is likely to conclude their shared professions.
